    <description>The Lost doesn't have health, but he can't do anything with hearts like the Keeper can. This mod changes that! Now, if you pick up:
[LIST]
[*] a black heart - breaking the mantle will give the Necronomicon effect
[*] a golden heart - breaking the mantle will spawn a few pennies and apply Midas's Touch to enemies close by
[*] a rotten heart - clearing rooms or breaking the mantle will spawn blue flies
[*] an eternal heart - breaking the mantle regenerates it instantly
[/LIST]
Once broken, the effect goes away until you pick up another heart. Heart effects also override each other - you can only have one at a time. Unless you've picked up Birthright, in which case they stack! The effects will still all go away at once, though.

This mod was inspired by [URL=https://www.youtube.com/c/Hutts2]Hutts[/URL]; he described on stream a hypothetical mod very similar to this one.

If you think soul hearts should do anything, comment with what it should be!</description>
